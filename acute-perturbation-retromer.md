ABSTRACT
The human retromer is a stable heterotrimer of VPS35, VPS29 and VPS26 whose
principal role is to orchestrate the endosomal retrieval of hundreds of internalised cargo
and promote their recycling to the cell surface; a prototypical cargo being the glucose
transporter GLUT1. Retromer’s role in a distinct endosomal retrieval pathway, the
retrograde sorting of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) to
the trans-Golgi network (TGN), remains controversial. Here we have developed and
applied knocksideways to acutely inactivate retromer and by visualising the sorting of
endogenous GLUT1 and CI-MPR provide insight into the temporal dynamics of
endosomal cargo sorting in HeLa and H4 human neuroglioma cells. While retromer
knocksideways led to the development of time-resolved defects in cell surface sorting of
GLUT1 we failed to observe defects in the sorting of the CI-MPR. In contrast
knocksideways of ESCPE-1, a key regulator of retrograde CI-MPR sorting, resulted in a
time-resolved defect in CI-MPR sorting. Together these data provide independent
evidence consistent with a comparatively limited role for retromer in ESCPE-1 dependent
CI-MPR retrograde sorting in HeLa and H4 human neuroglioma cells.

INTRODUCTION
The endosomal pathway functions as a major intracellular hub for the sorting of numerous
integral proteins, which include signalling receptors, adhesion molecules, nutrient
transporters, ion channels, and their associated proteins and lipids (collectively termed
‘cargoes’) (Maxfield and McGraw, 2004; Grant and Donaldson, 2009; Cullen and
Steinberg, 2018). On entering the pathway, cargoes are sorted between two fates: they
are either selected for degradation within the lysosome or retrieved from this fate and
promoted for recycling to the plasma membrane and the trans-Golgi network (TGN)
(Cullen and Steinberg, 2018). The efficient sorting of cargo is essential for normal cellular
homeostasis and defects in sorting are increasingly linked with human physiology and
pathophysiology (Schreij et al., 2016; Cullen and Steinberg, 2018).

Sequence-dependent cargo sorting for retrieval and recycling is orchestrated by highly
conserved multi-protein complexes that include the retromer and retriever complexes, the
COMMD/CCDC22/CCDC93 (CCC) complex, and the ‘Endosomal SNX-BAR sorting
complex for promoting exit 1’ (ESCPE- 1 ) complex (Seaman et al., 1998; Carlton et al.,
2004; Phillips-Krawczak et al., 2015; McNally et al., 2017; Simonetti et al., 2019). These
bind to sorting motifs present within the intracellular cytoplasmic domains of cargo either
directly (Fjorback et al., 2012; Phillips-Krawczak et al., 2015; Bartuzi et al., 2016; Lucas
et al., 2016; Kvainickas et al., 2017; Simonetti et al., 2019) or indirectly via cargo adaptors
(Strochlic et al., 2007; Lauffer et al., 2010; Harterink et al., 2011; Temkin et al., 2011;
Steinberg et al., 2012; Steinberg et al., 2013; Gallon et al., 2014; McNally et al., 2017).
Working alongside these complexes, the endosome-associated Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome
protein and SCAR Homologue (WASH) complex drives the ARP2/3-mediated formation
of branched F-actin networks (Derivery et al., 2009; Gomez and Billadeau, 2009).
Together, cargo recognition and organisation of a localised F-actin network leads to the
formation of one or more retrieval sub-domains on the cytosolic face of the endosomal
membrane that provide platforms for the co-ordinated biogenesis of cargo-enriched
transport carriers (Puthenveedu et al., 2010).

In higher metazoans, retromer is a stable heterotrimer of VPS35, VPS29 and VPS
(mammals express two paralogs VPS26A or VPS26B) (Burd and Cullen, 2014). Retromer
is associated to endosomes through binding to sorting nexin-3 (SNX3) (Harterink et al.,
2011), RAB7-GTP (Rojas et al., 2008; Seaman et al., 2009) and by association to cargo
presented sorting motifs (Harrison et al., 2014; Lucas et al., 2016). Retromer also binds
to sorting nexin-27 (SNX27), a cargo adaptor for the sequence-dependent inclusion of
around 400 cargo proteins that contain a carboxy-terminal PDZ-binding motif (Temkin et

al., 2011; Steinberg et al., 2013; Gallon et al., 2014; Clairfeuille et al., 2016). Retromer’s
principal role therefore is to orchestrate the retrieval of hundreds of internalised cargo and
to promote their recycling to the cell surface (Chen et al., 2010; Temkin et al., 2011;
Steinberg et al., 2013). That said, controversy remains as to the role of retromer in a
distinct retrieval pathway, the retrograde endosome-to-TGN sorting of the cation-
independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) (reviewed in Seaman, 2018).

At steady state, CI-MPR is enriched at the TGN where it associates with newly
synthesised hydrolase precursors (Braulke and Bonifacino, 2009). The resulting CI-
MPR:hydrolase complex is transported to the endosomal pathway, where the acidified
endosomal lumen induces the release of the hydrolase. While the hydrolase precursors
are delivered to the lysosome, where they contribute to the degradative capacity of this
organelle, the unoccupied CI-MPR is retrieved and recycled to the TGN for further rounds
of hydrolase delivery. Many studies in mammalian cells are consistent with retromer in
regulating CI-MPR transport (Arighi et al., 2004; Seaman, 2004; Seaman, 2007; Wassmer
et al., 2007; Bulankina et al., 2009; Harbour et al., 2010; Hao et al., 2013; Breusegem and
Seaman, 2014; McGough et al., 2014; Cui et al., 2019). However, we and others have
recently questioned this model (Kvainickas et al., 2017; Simonetti et al., 2017). Rather,
structural, biochemical and functional evidence has associated ESCPE- 1 in sequence-
dependent endosome-to-TGN CI-MPR transport through direct recognition of a bipartite
sorting motif (Kvainickas et al., 2017; Simonetti et al., 2017; Simonetti et al., 2019).

Part of this controversy may stem from technical variability and in particular the reliance
on the generation of retromer knockdown and knockout cells (Seaman, 2018). These
procedures induce the gradual loss of retromer expression over the course of hours and
days, a time window that has the potential to initiate the activation of compensatory
pathways that suppress phenotypes or result in variable and subtle phenotypes. Here we
have applied the ‘knocksideways’ methodology (Robinson et al., 2010) to acutely remove
retromer and trap this complex on an organelle not implicated in retromer function. Using
time-resolved analysis of cargo trafficking, we show that while acute retromer inactivation
leads to robust defects in the endosomal recycling of the prototypical retromer cargo
GLUT1, no detectable perturbation was observed in the distribution of the CI-MPR. In
contrast, acute knocksideways mediated inactivate of ESCPE- 1 results in perturbed
endosome-to-TGN transport of the CI-MPR. Our study therefore defines a method for the
acute inactivation of endosomal retrieval and recycling complexes and provides further
data to support the need to reflect on the central role of retromer in the retrograde sorting
from the endosome to the trans-Golgi network.

RESULTS
Retromer knocksideways design and temporal dynamics.

To design the retromer knocksideways, we first engineered a cassette encoding for the
core VPS35 subunit fused through a carboxy-terminal flexible linker to green fluorescent
protein (GFP), which was itself linked to the amino-terminus of rapamycin-binding (FRB)
domain (resultant construct encode VPS35-GFP-FRB, Figure 1A). In light of evidence
linking retromer to aspects of lysosomal function (e.g. Kvainickas et al., 2019), we utilised
a modified version of FRB (T2098L) that enables the induction of heterodimerisation by
rapalog (AP21967), a compound that has a lower affinity to endogenous mTOR than
rapamycin (Clackson et al., 1998). To validate that the VPS35-GFP-FRB chimera was
functional we expressed the construct in a previously characterised VPS35 knockout
HeLa cell line (Kvainickas et al., 2017). The VPS35-GFP-FRB chimera localised to
cytosolic puncta that were identified as endosomes by means of colocalization with the
endosome marker EEA1 (Supplementary Figure 1A). GFP-nanotrap immunoprecipitation
confirmed that VPS35-GFP-FRB retained the ability to associate with the core retromer
components VPS26 and VPS29 (Supplementary Figure 1B). Consistent with retromer
assembly, expression of the VPS35-GFP-FRB chimera in the VPS35 knockout HeLa cells
reverted the observed lysosomal missorting of GLUT1 and allowed recycling of the
transporter back to the cell surface (Supplementary Figure 1C and D). The designed
VPS35-GFP-FRB chimera is therefore correctly localised to endosomes and displays the
ability to assemble into a retromer complex that retains its function in endosomal cargo
retrieval and recycling.

To engineer the acceptor compartment, we fused red fluorescent protein (RFP) to FKBP
and linked this to either a mitochondrial targeting sequence (yeast Tom70p – forming Mito-
RFP-FKBP (Robinson et al., 2010) or a peroxisomal targeting sequence (PEX3 (residues
1 - 42) – forming PEX-RFP-FKBP (Kapitein et al., 2010)). To ensure a balanced co-
expression, we cloned the genes encoding for Mito-RFP-FKBP and VPS35-GFP-FRB into
a bicistronic vector and generated a corresponding bicistronic vector for PEX-RFP-FKBP
and VSP35-GFP-FRB (Figure 1A). To visualise the temporal dynamics of retromer
knocksideways we performed live imaging immediately after the application of rapalog.
For both the mitochondrial and peroxisomal knocksideways systems we observed
dynamic accumulation of VPS35-GFP-FRB onto the corresponding acceptor
compartment (Supplementary Movies 1A and B), such that approximately 10 minutes after

induction of dimerization there was clear co-localization between retromer and the
acceptor compartment (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure 1E).

Considering that retromer has been implicated in mitochondrial function (Braschi et al.,
2010; Tang et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016), we decided to focus on developing the
peroxisomal acceptor compartment system: to date, peroxisomes have not been
implicated in retromer biology. To increase the capacity of the acceptor compartment we
converted PEX-RFP-FKBP to PEX-Myc-3xFKBP (each FKBP separated by flexible linkers
GGSGGGSGGAP) (Figure 1A). In transiently transfected HeLa cells, the PEX-Myc-
3xFKBP chimera displayed colocalization with the known peroxisome marker PMP
(Supplementary Figure 1F).

In VPS35 knockout HeLa cells transiently transfected to express PEX 3 - myc-3xFKBP and
VPS35-GFP-FRB, the addition of 100 nM of rapalog established that rerouting of VPS35-
GFP-FRB from EEA1-positive endosomes to peroxisomes was achieved within 10
minutes and was complete by 30 minutes (Figure 1C-E) - in the continued presence of
rapalog the peroxisome rerouted VPS35-GFP-FRB was retained on this organelle
(maximum time studied 24 hours). Together these data establish a method for the acute
knocksideways of a functional VPS35-GFP-FRB construct.

Using knocksideways to examine in cellulo retromer assembly.
GFP-nanotrap immunoisolation is an established method for identifying protein-protein
interactions, including those of the retromer complex (McGough et al., 2014; McMillan et
al., 2016). Here we used knocksideways to analyse protein-protein interactions in cellulo.
Consistent with the assembly of VPS35-GFP-FRB into a functional heterotrimeric complex
(Supplementary Figure 1B), analysis of the endogenous localisation of VPS26 revealed
that it too was rerouted to peroxisomes with a similar kinetic profile to that observed for
VPS35-GFP-FRB (the lack of a suitable antibody precluded the equivalent analysis of
VPS29) (Figure 2 A and B). In addition, the major retromer accessory complex, the FAM
containing WASH complex (Derivery et al., 2009; Gomez and Billadeau, 2009; Harbour et
al., 2012; Jia et al., 2012) was also rerouted to peroxisomes upon retromer knocksideways
(Figure 2 C and D, Supplementary Figure 2 A and B). Supporting evidence that a sub-
population of the WASH complex is associated with endosomes independent of retromer
(McNally et al., 2017; MacDonald et al., 2018), a significant amount of the WASH complex
was retained on endosomes even after retromer knocksideways (Figure 2 C and E,
Supplementary Figure 2 A, C and D). Retromer knocksideways was selective in that

VPS35L, the core component of the functionally distinct retriever complex (McNally et al.,
2017), retained its endosome association and was not recruited to peroxisomes upon
retromer knocksideways (Supplementary Figure 2 E-G).

Given the selectivity of retromer knocksideways we also decided to apply this
methodology to examine the in cellulo relationship between retromer and the SNX-BAR
proteins that assemble to form the ESCPE-1 complex (Simonetti et al., 2019). In yeast
these SNX-BAR proteins associate with the Vps26:Vps35:Vps29 heterotrimer to form the
stable pentameric retromer complex (Seaman et al., 1998). In metazoans however,
retromer and ESCPE- 1 appear to function independently, which is inconsistent with the
formation of a long-lived and stable pentameric complex (Kvainickas et al., 2017;
Simonetti et al., 2017). Indeed, we failed to observe the rerouting of endogenous SNX1,
a component of the ESCPE-1 complex, onto peroxisomes after 24 hours of rapalog
treatment (Figure 2F-H). These data therefore support the in cellulo and in vivo evidence
that in metazoans retromer and ESCPE- 1 have evolved into functionally distinct
complexes (Kvainickas et al., 2017; Simonetti et al., 2017; Simonetti et al., 2019; Strutt et
al., 2019). Overall, the designed VPS35 knocksideways provides a method for the acute
and selective rerouting of retromer (and its functional coupled accessory proteins) away
from endosomes to the neighbouring peroxisome organelle.

Acute retromer knocksideways leads to a time-resolved GLUT1 sorting defect.
Retromer and retromer-associated cargo adaptors have been shown to control the
endosomal retrieval and recycling of >400 cell surface proteins including the glucose
transporter GLUT1 (Steinberg et al., 2013). To define the functional consequences of
retromer knocksideways we examined the steady-state distribution of GLUT1 in VPS
knockout HeLa cells rescued by expression of VPS35-GFP-FRB knocksideways.
Following the addition of rapalog for 24 hours, fixed cell confocal imaging revealed a
GLUT1 missorting phenotype, defined by the steady-state loss of GLUT1 at the cell
surface and the enrichment of GLUT1 with LAMP1-positive late endosomes / lysosomes
(Figure 3 A and B). To time-resolve the appearance of the GLUT1 trafficking phenotype,
we fixed cells at various time points following rapalog addition. Quantification established
that a statistically significant GLUT1 missorting phenotype began to emerge after 1- 3
hours of retromer knocksideways and reached a maximum penetrance after 10 hours
(Figure 3 C and D). The difference between the time scales of retromer knocksideways
(Figure 1C-E) compared with the appearance of the GLUT1 missorting phenotype is
entirely consistent with the known rate of GLUT1 lysosomal mediated degradation

observed upon retromer suppression and reflects the relatively slow rate of endocytosis
of this transporter (Steinberg et al., 2013).

The missorting of GLUT1 upon retromer knocksideways was not the result of a global
effect on endosomal sorting as the endosomal retrieval and recycling of the retriever-
dependent cargo, α 5 β 1 - integrin was not affected upon retromer knocksideways
(Supplementary Figure 3A and B) - consistent with the lack of effect of retromer
knocksideways on the endosomal association of the retriever complex (Supplementary
Figure 2E-G). Moreover, the development of the GLUT1 missorting did not stem from the
recruiting of ‘foreign’ proteins to peroxisomes as retromer knocksideways performed in
wild-type HeLa cells, which retain expression of endogenous VPS35 that is not subject to
knocksideways, did not illicit the development of a GLUT1 missorting phenotype
(Supplementary Figure 3C and D). Together, these data support that it is the specific
removal and inactivation of retromer that causes the time-resolved development of the
observed GLUT1 missorting phenotype.

Retromer-independent CI-MPR retrograde trafficking.
Next, we investigated the role of retromer in the retrograde trafficking of CI-MPR from
endosomes to the TGN (Arighi et al., 2004; Seaman, 2004; Kvainickas et al., 2017;
Simonetti et al., 2017; Cui et al., 2019). In VPS35 knockout HeLa cells rescued through
expression of VPS35-GFP-FRB, the CI-MPR is chiefly localized to the perinuclear TGN
as defined through co-localization with TGN markers Golgin97 and TGN46 (Figure 4A and
B, Supplementary Figure 4A and B). After the addition of rapalog and initiation of retromer
knocksideways we failed to observe a detectable alteration in the steady-state distribution
of the CI-MPR (Figure 4A and B, Supplementary Figure 4A and B) over a time frame
where the endosomal missorting of internalized GLUT1 was readily observed (Figure 3C
and D). Given that the endosome-to-TGN transport of the CI-MPR is considered to occur
over a period of approximately 20 - 30 minutes (Seaman, 2004), the acute perturbation of
retromer function does not appear to lead to a detectable defect in the endosomal sorting
of the CI-MPR. These data are consistent with a limited role for retromer in endosome-to-
TGN retrograde transport of this receptor (Kvainickas et al., 2017; Simonetti et al., 2017).

Knocksideways of ESCPE- 1 leads to a time-resolved defect in CI-MPR sorting.
The ESCPE-1 complex regulates sequence-dependent endosome-to-TGN transport of
the CI-MPR (Simonetti et al., 2019). ESCPE- 1 comprises a heterodimer of SNX1 or SNX
(these proteins are functionally redundant) associated with either SNX5 or SNX6, which

are also functionally redundant (Wassmer et al., 2009). Of these proteins, it is the PX
domains of SNX5 and SNX6 that directly bind to the ΦxΩxΦ(x)nΦ sorting motif in CI-MPR
to mediate endosome-to-TGN transport (Simonetti et al., 2019). To provide a positive
control for the lack of detectable effect of retromer knocksideways on CI-MPR trafficking
we therefore constructed a bicistronic vector encoding for PEX3-myc-3xFKBP and GFP-
FRB-SNX5 (Figure 1 A). When expressed in HeLa cells SNX5-GFP-FRB localised to
endosomes as defined by co-localization with EEA1 (Supplementary Figure 5A).
Interestingly, after rapalog addition we observed a slight recruitment of EEA1 to the
peroxisomal hook indicating a movement of the endosomal compartment to the
peroxisomal compartment (Figure 5A and B). However, this ‘dragging’ of endosomes was
not complete as there was still a loss of co-localization between GFP-FRB-SNX5 and
EEA1 (Figure 5A and C). In GFP-FRB-SNX5 knocksideways endogenous SNX1 was
recruited to peroxisomes after rapalog treatment with no loss of co-localization between
SNX5 and SNX1 indicating a recruitment of the functional ESCPE-1 complex (Figure 5D-
F).

Next we used the GFP-FRB-SNX5 knocksideways system to time-resolve CI-MPR
endosome-to-TGN trafficking. Expression of the GFP-FRB-SNX5 chimera in a previously
isolated and characterised SNX5/SNX6 double knockout HeLa cell line (Simonetti et al.,

reverted the observed missorting of the CI-MPR and allowed the receptor to return
to its normal steady-state localisation (Supplementary Figure 6A and B). Consistent with
the role of SNX5 in the ESCPE- 1 - mediated endosome-to-TGN transport of the CI-MPR
(Kvainickas et al., 2017; Simonetti et al., 2017; Simonetti et al., 2019), SNX
knocksideways in SNX5/SNX6 double knockout HeLa cells led to the time-resolved
appearance of a CI-MPR missorting phenotype as defined by a reduced enrichment of
the CI-MPR at the Golgin97 or TGN46-labelled TGN with a maximum penetrance at 6
hours (Figure 6A and B, Supplementary Figure 6C and D). There was no observed defect
in α 5 β 1 - integrin recycling during GFP-FRB-SNX5 knocksideways indicating the selective
nature of this procedure (Figure 6C and D). Together these data establish that acute
perturbation of the ESCPE-1 complex leads to a missorting of CI-MPR, thereby reinforcing
the functional significance of the lack of observed effect of retromer knocksideways on the
trafficking of this receptor.
H4 human neuroglioma knocksideways is consistent with a limited role for retromer
in retrograde CI-MPR trafficking.

Our study of endosomal cargo sorting associated with depletion or knocksideways of
sorting machinery has so far been limited to a single non-neuronal cell type. To extend
these observations, we therefore turned to H4 neuroglioma cells and generated both
retromer knockout (targeting VPS35) and ESCPE- 1 knockout cells (dual targeting of
SNX5 and SNX6). Interestingly, confocal imaging of the retromer knockout cells revealed
an enhanced intensity in the staining of endogenous CI-MPR that was not observed in the
ESCPE- 1 knockout cells (Figure 7A and B). Despite the increase in the CI-MPR signal
intensity, retromer knockout cells did not display a significant change in the quantified
Pearsons correlation coefficient between CI-MPR and Golgin97. This is consistent with a
limited role for retromer in CI-MPR retrograde trafficking in H4 neuroglioma cells (Figure
7 A and C). In contrast, the ESCPE- 1 knockout H4 neuroglioma cells displayed a clear
redistribution of CI-MPR to peripheral dispersed puncta (Figure 7A, D and Supplementary
Figure 7A).

To extend these data, we isolated individual clonal retromer and ESCPE- 1 knockout H
cell lines. Biochemical analysis of 3 independent clonal lines revealed that retromer
knockout resulted in a pronounced up-regulation of CI-MPR expression (Supplementary
Figure 7B). Moreover, the expression of another lysosomal hydrolase receptor, sortilin,
was also increased across all three independent lines as was the immature and mature
forms of the lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin D (Figure 7E-I). These increases in protein
expression were not observed across 3 independent ESCPE-1 knockout H4 cell lines
(Figure 7E-I).

To examine whether the increased expression of CI-MPR, sortilin and cathepsin D arose
from a retromer-dependent trafficking defect, which would be inconsistent with the lack of
effect of retromer knockout on the steady state distribution of CI-MPR (Figure 7A and C),
or reflected a longer-term compensatory mechanism we established the acute VPS
knocksideways methodology in H4 cells. Expression of VPS35-GFP-FRB rescued the
GLUT1 missorting phenotype in retromer knockout cells. Initiation of VPS
knocksideways resulted in a time-resolved missorting and accumulation of GLUT1 to
LAMP1 positive late endosomes and lysosomes (Figure 8A and B) confirming an acute
perturbation in retromer function (Figure 3 C and D). In a parallel time-resolved retromer
knocksideways we failed to detect a significant redistribution of CI-MPR away from TGN
markers Golgin97 and TGN46, consistent with retromer playing a limited role in retrograde
trafficking of CI-MPR in H4 cells (Figure 8C and D and Supplementary Figure 8A and B).
Together these data are more suggestive of the observed up-regulation in expression of

CI-MPR in retromer knockout cells arising as an indirect affect of a compensatory
pathway(s) rather than a direct endosome-to-TGN sorting phenotype.

DISCUSSION
Here we have developed and applied knocksideways to acutely inactivate retromer and
the ESCPE-1 complex. Previously developed to inactivate the AP1 and AP2 clathrin
adaptors (Robinson et al., 2010; Hirst et al., 2012), this approach provides a method to
acutely perturb sorting complex function in a time frame that better aligns with the dynamic
nature of endosomal membrane trafficking. By visualising the sorting of endogenous
GLUT1 and CI-MPR, our data provide insight into the temporal dynamics of endosomal
cargo sorting and support the established role of retromer in cell surface recycling (Chen
et al., 2010; Temkin et al., 2011; Steinberg et al., 2013). In contrast, we have provided
independent evidence consistent with a comparatively limited role for retromer in ESCPE-
1 dependent CI-MPR retrograde sorting in HeLa and H4 human neuroglioma cells
(Kvainickas et al., 2017; Simonetti et al., 2017; Simonetti et al., 2019).

In applying knocksideways we have established that retromer and ESCPE- 1 can be
specifically and rapidly inactivated leading to the time-resolved development of selective
cargo sorting defects through the endosomal pathway. Interestingly, in examining CI-MPR
phenotypes in H4 neuroglioma cells we have observed a clear distinction between the
effects of long-term retromer knockout and acute retromer knocksideways. Only in
retromer knockout cells did we observe an increase in the steady-state expression of not
only CI-MPR, but also sortillin and cathepsin D. The mechanistic basis of this
compensatory up-regulation is presently unclear but it may, in part, reflect indirect effects
on the control of RAB7 activity and perturbed mTORC1 signalling leading to induction of
autophagy (Jimenez-Orgaz et al., 2018; Kvainickas et al., 2019; Curnock et al., 2019) and
the swollen lysosomal phenotype previously documented in retromer knockout cells (Cui
et al., 2019).

In contrast to retromer’s pentameric assembly in yeast (Seaman et al., 1998), an
increasing body of biochemical, in cellulo and in vivo functional data point to the fact that
the equivalent metazoan assembly has evolved into two functionally distinct complexes,
the VPS26:VPS35:VPS29 retromer and the SNX1/SNX2:SNX5/SNX6 ESCPE-1 complex
(Norwood et al., 2011; Swarbrick et al., 2011; Kvainickas et al., 2017; Simonetti et al.,
2017; Simonetti et al., 2019; Strutt et al., 2019). In utilising knocksideways as an in cellulo

‘interaction’ assay we have provided further supporting evidence of the distinct nature of
the retromer and ESCPE-1 complexes. Specifically, acute knocksideways of the core
VPS35 retromer component results in the equivalent time-resolved knocksideways of the
endogenous population of VPS26 but has no detectable effect on the endosomal
localisation of ESCPE-1. This technically distinct approach therefore provides further data
to support the diversification of retromer and ESCPE-1 into two functionally distinct sorting
complexes.

The development of retromer knocksideways has also added to our understanding of the
endosomal association of the actin polymerising WASH complex. Direct binding of FAM
to VPS35 is a major mechanism for the retromer-dependent association of the WASH
complex to endosomes (Gomez and Billadeau, 2009; Harbour et al., 2012; Jia et al.,
2012). That said, increasing evidence suggests that a sub-population of the WASH
complex is associated to endosomes independent of retromer (McNally et al., 2017;
Kvainickas et al., 2017; Simonetti et al., 2017; MacDonald et al., 2018). Consistent with
these data, acute knocksideways of retromer induces a redistribution of a major proportion
of endogenous WASH but a significant sub-population retains an endosomal association.

In summary, by applying knocksideways we have visualized the acute inactivation of
retromer and ESCPE-1 and, through quantification of the temporal development of
resulting cargo sorting defects, provided clarification of the role of these complexes in the
sorting of CI-MPR and GLUT1. Moving forward, we aim to combine knocksideways and
our established unbiased proteomic quantification of the cell surface proteome to time-
resolve the functional role of endosomal sorting complexes in global cargo retrieval and
recycling.

Plasmids
A pIRESneo3 vector was adapted to generate the bicistronic knocksideways system.
First, VPS35-GFP and FRB (PCR from the Kinesin-FRB template gifted from L. Kapetein,
Utrecht University, Netherlands) were PCR overlapped together inserting a XhoI site
between VPS35-GRP and FRB and then ligated downstream of the IRES component
between the SmaI and PacI sites. PEX-RFP-FKBP was amplified from the template (gifted
from L. Kapetein, Utrecht University, Netherlands) and ligated into the MCS downstream
of the CMV promoter in pIRESNEO3 using EcoRV and NotI. The mitochondrial targeting
sequence (gift from Scottie Robinson CIMR, UK.) was inserted in place of the PEX
targeting sequence using the EcoRV and AgeI restriction sites. To create GFP-FRB-SNX
first, GFP-FRB was amplified and inserted between the SmaI and PacI sites to generate
a new FseI site upstream of the PacI restriction site. The new FseI and PacI site was used
to insert SNX5. The PEX-RFP-FKBP was converted to PEX-myc-3xFKBP by PCR of myc-
FKBP and inserted between the AgeI and NotI sites to generate PEX-myc-FKBP. The
AscI site (upstream of FKBP in the PEX-RFP-FKBP) was used to sequential insert two
FKBP cassettes using a MluI-AscI insertion (MluI compatible with AscI but destroying the
AscI site allowing the second insertion). CRISPR Cas9 plasmids were obtained from
Addgene (#62988, pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro PX459 V2.0)

Cell culture and DNA transfection
HeLa and H4 neuroglioma cells were cultured in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10%
(vol/vol) FCS (Sigma) and grown using standard conditions. Lipofectamine LTX was used
in DNA transfections. Per six well dish 2 μg of DNA was mixed with 4 μL of the LTX
supplement into 100 μL of Opti-Mem. In another incubation 100 μL of Opti-Mem was
mixed with 8 μL of Lipofectamine LTX. After a 5-minute incubation, the two 100 μL Opti-
Mem mixes were combined and incubated for a further 20 minutes. The 200 μL mix was
then added dropwise onto 60-80% confluent HeLa cells and transfected cells were left for
48 hours for DNA expression. VPS35 knockout HeLa cells and SNX5/SNX6 double
knockout was generated as previously described and cultured as stated above for wild-
type HeLa (Simonetti et al., 2017).

Generation of H4 clonal cells
H4 cells were seeded the day prior to transfection, then transiently transfected with
CRISPR plasmids encoding the Cas9 enzyme, a puromycin resistance marker and
specific gRNA guides against VPS35, SNX5 or SNX6 (Kvainickas et al., 2017; Simonetti
et al., 2017) using FuGENE® 6 (Promega). The day after transfection, cells are incubated
with 1 μg/mL puromycin for 24 hours to select for knockout cells. Following puromycin
selection, H4 cells were seeded into a 96-well plate at a density of 1 cell per well in 200
μL Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium (Thermo Fisher). Clones were grown to
confluency then expanded and screened for successful knockout deletion by Western
blotting.

GFP trap and Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in GFP trap buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5% NP-40 and Roche protease
inhibitor cocktail) and the lysate was added to pre-equilibrated GFP trap beads
(ChromoTek). Beads were washed 3 times in the GFP trap buffer and then lysates were
diluted in 2x sample buffer and boiled for 10 minutes. Proteins were resolved on a
NuPAGE 4-12% gels (Invitrogen) and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membrane
(EMD Millipore). Once transferred membranes were blocked in TBS 5% milk and the
primary antibody (see antibody section) was diluted in TBS 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 (TBS-T)
5% (w/v) milk and incubated with the membrane for 1 hour at room temperature or
overnight at 4oC. Membranes were washed 3 times in TBS-T. Secondary antibodies (see
antibody section) were diluted into TBS-T with 5% milk and 0.01% SDS and incubated
with the washed membrane for 1 hour at room temperature. TBS-T was used to wash the

membrane (3 times) prior to quantitative imaging using an Odyssey scanning system (LI-
COR Biosciences). Analysis was performed on Image Studio lite (LI-COR Biosciences).

Knocksideways.
pIRESNEO3 bicistronic vectors encoding the knocksideways peroxisomal/mitochondrial
acceptor compartment and either VPS35-GFP-FRB or GFP-FRB-SNX5 were transfected
into cells. Either 24 hours of 0.1% (v/v) ethanol vehicle was added to the 0 timepoint or
rapalog (100 nM) was added to the 24-hour timepoint. The following day rapalog was
added to the different timepoints and then cells were fixed and stained.

Immunofluorescent staining
Cells were washed once in PBS before fixation for 8 minutes in 4% PFA (16% PFA stock
diluted in PBS). Three washes in PBS were performed and then a 5-minute incubation
with PBS 100 mM glycine was used to quench the PFA. After three more PBS washes
cells were left in PBS overnight. Cells were incubated with PBS + 3% BSA and 0.1%
Triton-X100 for 10 minutes and then with PBS + 3% BSA for a further 10 minutes. Primary
antibodies (see antibody section) were diluted in PBS + 3% BSA and incubated for 1 hour.
Cells were washed 3 times with PBS with the secondary antibody (see antibody section)
being diluted into PBS + 3% BSA and incubated for 1 hour. Cells were washed 3 times
with PBS and washed once with distilled water before mounting the coverslips in
Fluoromount-G.

Microscopy and image analysis
For image acquisition a Leica SP5-AOBS confocal laser scanning confocal microscope
was used attached to a Leica DM I6000 inverted epifluorescence microscope. The 63x
HCX PL APO oil lens and standard acquisition software and detectors were used. Once
acquired Pearson’s correlation colocalization and signal intensity analyses were
quantified using Volocity 6.3 software (PerkinElmer). Image and line scan analysis was
completed using ImageJ FIJI software. GraphPad Prism 7 was used for presentation and
statistical analysis of data.

Live cell imaging was performed using a Leica SP8 AOBS confocal laser scanning
microscope attached to a Leica DM I6000 inverted epifluorescence microscope. The
adaptive focus control was used to prevent drift of the Z plane over time. The two hybrid
GaAsP detectors were used to enable low laser settings. Images were acquired using the
63x HC PL APO CS2 lens and a speed of one image per 10 seconds. Imaging was

performed at 37 oC and 2x rapalog DMEM complete media was added to the pre-selected
cell.
